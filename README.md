# Calculator

For now the only way to enter data is though the python code but I am working on adding input fields. 

The data values for both basic statistics and Normal Distribution can be entered within their respective code Blocks.

I WILL ADD LATEX INTEGRAION SOON

Updates and new features will be slow due to my busy schedule.
